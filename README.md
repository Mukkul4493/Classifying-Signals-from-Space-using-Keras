# Classifying-Signals-from-Space-using-Keras


In this project, we will use 2d spectrograms of deep space radio signals collected by antennas at the SETI (Search for Extra Terrestial Intelligence) institute. They are faint radio signals from outer space. The original signals were not spectrograms but time series data collected. They were later converted into spectrograms and that is what we will be using. We will treat these spectrograms as images and use an image classification model  to classify these radio signals into 4 categories in real time to allow the signal detection system increase its efficiency to detect signals.
